## FSLC Guest Presentation: Thomas Hatch & Tyler Johnson of SaltStack 

I am pleased to announce two special guests from SaltStack will present at our
FSLC meeting tonight.

SaltStack is a Utah tech-startup that created an open-source project called Salt.
Salt is a Python-based configuration management software and remote execution engine.

Thomas Hatch & Tyler Johnson will introduce *Plugin Oriented Programming*
(POP), an exciting, new way to design large-scale software projects.  Learn
what it's like to work on an real-life project and how *you* can get involed in
open-source development right now.

Pizza will be provided.

## Using the Raspberry Pi

This mini computer uses an HDMI port for display output.  It has four USB ports
suitable for a mouse and keyboard.  The included microSD card functions as the
RPi's hard disk.  The RPi has an Ethernet port and a WiFi adapter for network
connectivity.  You may plug it into a TV or computer screen, or you may access
it "headless" over the internet via SSH (advanced).


## Installing and setting up your Raspberry Pi
