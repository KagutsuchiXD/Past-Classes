T: Constant Linear Velocity implies that data are stored with uniform density
F: Constant Linear Velocity implies that the rotation speed of the disk is constant
T: Constant Angular Velocity implies that data are stored with varying density

T: Error correction codes detect and protect from data corruption
T: A hard drive's advertised capacity is likely much smaller than it's absolute capacity
F: A solid-state drive cannot fail because it has no moving parts

T: Seek Time is the delay to position the read/write head over the track
T: Rotational Latency is the delay for the sector to rotate to the disk head
F: The Random Access Time of a spinning disk depends only upon the Rotational Latency

F: RAID using only data striping will have improved reliability
T: RAID utilizing only mirroring will not have improved I/O performance
T: RAID with both striping and parity improves both reliability and performance
