T: The page table itself is kept in memory
F: The translation look-aside buffer itself is kept in memory
T: The translation look-aside buffer is a high-speed, associative memory cache

F: A system's virtual address space can be no larger than its physical RAM
T: Demand paging is when a process is loaded one page at a time, only as needed
T: Pure demand paging loads an entire process only as needed

F: A page fault happens when an invalid address is requested
T: Pages which are loaded into physical memory frames are "memory resident"
T: A lazy swapper only brings pages into memory when they are actually needed

F: System load is the max # of processes system can accommodate efficiently
T: Belady's Anomaly is when adding more frames leads to more page faults
T: Copy On Write is when a pager defers copying shared pages until one process changes it

T: Thrashing is when a process spends more time paging than executing the process
F: Swapping is when a process spends more time paging than executing the process
T: The Optimal Page Replacement algorithm is impossible to implement IRL

T: Changes to a shared memory mapped file are automatically persisted to the file
F: Changes to a private memory mapped file are automatically persisted to the file
T: Memory mapped files can be treated as arrays in code
