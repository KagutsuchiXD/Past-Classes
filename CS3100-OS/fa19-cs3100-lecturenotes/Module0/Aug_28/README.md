# Announcements

## USU Network outage yesterday

If you couldn't connect to the GitLab server, try again today.



## GitLab Confirmation Emails

Many students weren't receiving their confirmation emails from GitLab at their
aggiemail.usu.edu addresses.  Many students did.

Why this happened is a mystery that I asked USU IT to look into.  I hope they
didn't break the network while they were looking into it!

I have suspended confirmation emails for the time being.

Contact me if you still can't get into your account.

# Introduce Assignment #0

The purpose of this assignment is to get you familiarized with working in a command line environment by compiling and running a Java program from the command line.

# Mud card followup: What is a computer?

### What do these devices have in common?
1. Slide rule
2. Abacus
3. Tinker-toy contraption
4. Difference Engine


1. They store data
2. They have states
3. Embody algorithms or "programs", but a user has to interpret it



### What are their differences?
1. Some do the computation on their own without a human making choices
2. Some need a human to move them, and interpret their state


* Some of them are electric, others are analog
* Some of these devices require continual human interaction to operate:
    * cranking the gears
    * moving the beads
    * sliding the rule and cursor about
    * pull moths out of the relays



#### Definition of a computer (from Wikipedia)

> A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of
> arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

The important part is *automatically*

Once the device is set up and turned on, it follows its instructions, including
making any decisions, automatically without further human intervention.

# How do I use Git to submit my homework?

These eight fundamental git commands are enough to succeed in my class:

1.  git status
2.  git init
3.  git add
4.  git config
5.  git commit
6.  ~~git remote~~
7.  ~~git push~~
8.  git log

If you are already comfortable with these commands, you are free to go

We'll discuss `git remote` and `git push` on Friday.
