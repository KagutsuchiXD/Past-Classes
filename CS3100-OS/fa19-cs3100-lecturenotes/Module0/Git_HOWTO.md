## How to learn Git

My own experience as well as discussions with industry professionals have
convinced me that being able to competently use a version control system is a
vital skill in today's job market. I am also convinced that your becoming
proficient with a version control system will make your time as a student more
effective and enjoyable. Therefore, mastery of Git is an important goal of this
class.

If you know anything about git, you probably know that git does not have a
reputation as being a user-friendly piece of software. Repetition and continual
exercise is the only way that you will acquire the necessary level of
experience with this tool. I require that you submit all assignments as git
repositories so that you will have ample practice using git.

If you are new to git, you will find a steep learning curve at first. Don't
give up, and don't worry about your mistakes! The power of git is that it
allows you to bravely forge ahead, confident that you can recover from any
mistakes you may make along the way. Git is your safety net.

We'll start off with eight basic commands, and build from there.

### The eight fundamental Git commands

|**Command**                                       | **Purpose**
|--------------------------------------------------|------------
|[git status](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) | Status of local files (which files are changed, which files haven't been added to the repository, etc.)
|[git init](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init)     | Create a new repository on your computer
|[git add](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-add)       | Select files for inclusion into the repository
|[git config](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config) | Set and view git's configuration parameters
|[git commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) | Permanently record changes into the repository
|[git remote](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote) | Associate a repository on another computer with this local repository
|[git push](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push)     | Send committed changes to another repository
|[git log](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)       | Review the history of commits


As you explore git's capabilities [this reference](https://git-scm.com/docs) will be useful.

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS).  Think of it as the ultimate "undo"
button for an entire project (a.k.a. repository). Git can remember all of the
changes you've made to any files, no matter which program you've used to change
them.

#### repository = a directory which has been initialized for use with git

Instead of manually keeping track of lots of backup directories for your code
(BlackJack.1, BlackJack.2, BlackJack.3, BlackJack.4, etc.), git will remember
what you were doing at every step of the way, and gives you a convenient way to
undo your work, and compare your current files to what they were previously.


### Is Git the same thing as GitHub?

Git is not made by GitHub; GitHub just made the hub.

There are several "hubs" Git users may use to share their code online; GitHub
is just the most popular right now.  Others include GitLab, Bitbucket,
Sourcehut, Beanstalk, SourceForge, among others.   While we use GitLab in this
course, the skills you learn here are easily transferred to other services.
