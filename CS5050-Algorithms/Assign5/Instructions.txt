Instructions for running code.

1. compile the .py file
2. to run the highschool algorithm by itself call highschool(p, q),
 with p and q being the polynomials you wish to multiply.
3. to run the divide and conquer algorithm by itself call dc(p, q, n),
 with p and q being the polynomials you wish to multiply and n being the
 length of the arrays you are passing in.
4. to run the empirical study, call empiricalstudy(). It will run each algorithm
 10 times for polynomial arrays of increasing size starting at size 32 and ending
 at size 8,192. Then it will output the results to empiricalresults.txt and show 
 the graph of the results when it is finished.
