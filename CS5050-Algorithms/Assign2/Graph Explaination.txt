I think the graph appears the way it does because the DP version of our algorithm is basically linear in runtime.
This is why the runtime is so short compared to the memoizing version which is still recursive meaning it's runtime grows
dependent on the input size. Th large fluctuations in the runtime for the memoizing algorithm are probaly due to 
some sets of item sizes fiting more easily into the knapsacks than others.
